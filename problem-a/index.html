          </a></cite> in the TV Series "Suits",
        who is a legendary corporate lawyer or some people say he 
        is the best closer in the city. He almost never loses, 
        and he worked very hard from an assistant district attorney
        to the managing partner of Specter Litt, which is one of the 
        best law firms in New York. He is righteous and smart, he is 
        also emotional and caring for other people. He is a complexity of 
        many things, a very intersting character to watch.
